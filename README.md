# Consulting-as-Code™
### The Autonomous Successor to the Consulting Industry

Consulting-as-Code™ (CaC) is a new operating model for strategy.

It replaces labor-driven consulting — interviews, slide decks, partner reviews, and opinion arbitration — with a **deterministic, multi-agent reasoning system** that computes strategy directly from enterprise reality.

This repository is the **canonical specification** of Consulting-as-Code™.

---

## What Consulting-as-Code™ Is
- A **neuro-symbolic reasoning architecture** for strategy
- A **multi-agent system** that replaces the consulting pyramid
- A **truth engine**, not a language model
- A **compute-scaled alternative** to people-scaled consulting

CaC ingests real enterprise inputs (calls, transcripts, constraints, financials) and produces:
- Constraint-valid strategies
- Math-verified ROI
- Prioritized roadmaps
- Board-ready deliverables  
—in minutes, not months.

---

## What Consulting-as-Code™ Is Not
- Not a chatbot  
- Not “AI for consultants”  
- Not augmentation  
- Not automation of slide creation  
- Not probabilistic advice  

Consulting-as-Code™ does not generate narratives.  
It **enforces reality**.

---

## Why This Exists
Markets now move at machine speed.  
Strategy still moves at human speed.

That velocity mismatch is fatal.

Consulting did not fail — **physics caught up with it**.

## Repository Structure
This repo separates **argument**, **architecture**, and **proof**.

- `/whitepaper` → Canonical argument & category definition
- `/architecture` → System design & reasoning model
- `/agents` → Agent roles & responsibilities
- `/audits` → Stress tests that break humans and LLMs
- `/diagrams` → Visual system references
- `/meta` → Evaluation frameworks & terminology

The PDF on the website is a compiled artifact.  
**This repo is the source of truth.**

## Status
This repository defines the Consulting-as-Code™ category.

Implementation lives elsewhere.
