# Consulting-as-Code™ — System Architecture

Consulting-as-Code™ is a deterministic, multi-agent reasoning system that converts
enterprise conversations into validated strategic decisions.

It replaces human consulting workflows with computation.

## High-Level Flow

**Input → Reasoning → Validation → Output**

1. **Enterprise Inputs**
   - Sales calls
   - Discovery interviews
   - Stakeholder notes
   - Technical constraints
   - Financial context

2. **Neural Understanding Layer**
   - Extracts meaning, signals, urgency, entities
   - Performs no decision-making
   - Performs no math

3. **Strategic Call Intelligence (SCI) Engine**
   - 9 parallel agents
   - Replaces discovery workshops
   - Produces a structured Discovery Profile

4. **Logic Core (Decision Engine)**
   - Constraint Agent enforces feasibility
   - Math Agent validates economics
   - Strategy Agent prioritizes initiatives
   - Cross-agent validation resolves conflicts

5. **AI Discovery Engine**
   - 6 agents
   - Builds use cases, roadmaps, vendor mapping, risks
   - Operates only on validated logic

6. **Output Layer**
   - Executive summary
   - Financial models
   - Strategic roadmap
   - Risk matrix
   - Board-ready deliverables

## Core Design Principles

- **Determinism over probability**
- **Constraint enforcement over creativity**
- **Parallel reasoning over sequential work**
- **Auditability over narrative**

---

## Key Distinction

Most AI systems *generate advice*.

Consulting-as-Code™ **computes decisions**.

This architectural separation is what allows the system to:
- Reject bad strategies
- Enforce reality
- Scale without degradation

---

## Outcome

Strategy becomes:
- Immediate
- Auditable
- Scalable
- Owned by the enterprise

This is the architectural foundation of Consulting-as-Code™.
