# Audit 01 — Margin Squeeze + Code Freeze (Healthcare)

## Industry
Healthcare

## Scenario
CEO reports a $36.5M revenue loss due to patient throughput issues.

CFO clarifies:
- Operating margin: 5%

CIO adds:
- 18-month Epic code freeze
- No system integrations allowed

---

## Traps

- **Math Trap:** Gross vs. net impact confusion
- **Constraint Trap:** Ignoring explicit IT freeze

---

## Expected Failures

**Human Consultants**
- Anchor on $36.5M headline
- Scope multi-year EMR transformation

**LLMs**
- Recommend Epic integration
- Hallucinate workflow automation

---

## Consulting-as-Code™ Result

- Math Agent computes:
  - $36.5M × 5% = **$1.825M true P&L impact**
- Constraint Agent:
  - Blocks all Epic integrations
- Strategy Agent:
  - Proposes standalone mobile workflow optimization

---

## Outcome
**PASS**

Correct economics.
Constraints enforced.
Strategy aligned to reality.

---

## Why This Matters
Healthcare runs on thin margins.
Using the wrong number destroys value.

Consulting-as-Code™ enforced the only number that mattered.
