# The Logic Core

The Logic Core is the decision engine inside Consulting-as-Code™.

It replaces the partner layer of consulting by enforcing:
- Reality
- Math
- Prioritization

---

## Core Responsibility

The Logic Core ensures that **no strategy survives** unless it is:

- Feasible
- Economically valid
- Correctly prioritized

This is not advisory logic.
It is enforcement logic.

## The Three Agents

### Constraint Agent
- Converts explicit statements into hard rules
- Builds constraint graphs
- Removes invalid solution paths

### Math Agent
- Executes financial logic in a computation environment
- Rejects non-validated numbers
- Calculates opportunity cost

### Strategy Agent
- Forces prioritization
- Eliminates low-impact initiatives
- Aligns urgency with spend

---

## Validation Loop

1. Strategy proposes
2. Constraint enforces
3. Math validates
4. Conflicts resolved
5. Repeat until stable

If stability is not reached, no output is produced.

---

## Determinism

Given the same inputs:
- Outputs are identical
- Reasoning is traceable
- Decisions are auditable

This is a hard requirement.

---

## Why This Matters

Consulting fails when:
- Politics override truth
- Math is hand-waved
- Constraints are inconvenient

The Logic Core does not negotiate.

That is the point.
