# Why Consulting Failed (Without Failing)

McKinsey did not fail.
BCG did not fail.
Boutique firms did not fail.

The environment outgrew their operating model.

## The Eight Structural Failure Modes

![Traditional Consulting vs Consulting-as-Code](../diagrams/cac_traditional_vs_cac__analog_vs_compute.png)\

### 1. The Velocity Deficit
Human-paced delivery cannot match machine-paced markets.

### 2. Cognitive Fragility
Fatigue, bias, memory loss, and interpretation errors scale poorly.

### 3. The Mathematics Problem
Strategy is math.
Humans approximate. LLMs hallucinate.
Neither validates deterministically.

### 4. The Pyramid Problem
Junior labor is now computable.
The leverage model collapses.

### 5. The Narrative Problem
Stories replace truth when validation is slow.

### 6. The Hallucination Mirror
Consultants fill gaps subconsciously.
LLMs fill them fluently.
Both are unsafe.

### 7. The Scalability Trap
Human teams scale linearly.
Enterprise demand scales exponentially.

### 8. The Capability Reversal
Enterprises no longer want rented intelligence.
They want owned capability.

## The Verdict

This is not a critique of people.
It is a recognition of physics.

There is consulting **before** Consulting-as-Code™  
and consulting **after** Consulting-as-Code™.

Only one survives the next decade.
