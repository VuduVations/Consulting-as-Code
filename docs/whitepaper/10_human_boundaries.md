# Where Human Judgment Still Matters

Consulting-as-Code™ is powerful.

It is not omniscient.
It is not emotional.
It is not political.

This is intentional.

## What CaC Handles Better Than Humans

- Constraint enforcement
- Financial validation
- Logical consistency
- Parallel reasoning
- Scale and speed

Anything computable belongs to the machine.

## What Remains Irreducibly Human

### 1. Novel Situations
Black swans, first-of-kind moves, and uncharted territory
benefit from human intuition.

### 2. Relationships
Coalition-building, trust, and executive alignment
are human skills.

### 3. Implementation
Organizations change through people, not logic alone.

### 4. Ethics
Trade-offs in gray regulatory or moral zones
require human accountability.

## The Future Model

Not humans *or* machines.

Humans **with** machines — but only where humans add value.

Consulting-as-Code™ handles the computable.
Humans handle the irreducible.
