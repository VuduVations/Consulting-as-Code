# Glossary

**Consulting-as-Code™ (CaC)**  
A deterministic, multi-agent reasoning system that converts enterprise inputs into validated strategic decisions.

**Strategic Call Intelligence (SCI)**  
The discovery replacement layer: parallel agents that extract constraints, stakeholders, urgency, economics, and requirements into a structured profile.

**Discovery Profile**  
The structured output of SCI used as immutable input to the Logic Core.

**Logic Core**  
The decision engine that enforces feasibility, validates math, and forces prioritization via cross-agent validation.

**Constraint Enforcement**  
Hard blocking of infeasible solution paths based on explicit constraints (regulatory, security, technical, budget, timing).

**Determinism**  
Given the same inputs, the system produces consistent outputs (and explainable traceability).

**Auditability**  
The ability to trace recommendations back to constraints, assumptions, and computed financial validation.

**Parallel Reasoning**  
Multiple agents operating concurrently with shared memory and conflict resolution, replacing sequential human workflows.

**Stress Testing Audits**  
Adversarial scenarios designed to break consulting narratives and probabilistic AI outputs; CaC is designed to survive failure conditions.

**Neuro-Symbolic Architecture**  
A system design where neural models extract signals and structured facts, while symbolic logic enforces constraints and computed validation.
