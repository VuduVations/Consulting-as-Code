# The Problem: Strategy Is a Latency-Sensitive Function

Modern enterprises operate at machine speed.

Capital moves instantly.
Markets reprice continuously.
Competitors ship weekly.

Strategy does not.

Traditional consulting delivers insight through:
- Interviews
- Workshops
- Slide synthesis
- Partner arbitration

This model introduces **structural latency** that cannot be optimized away.

Latency is no longer an inconvenience.
It is a competitive failure mode.

## Strategy Is Now Physics-Bound

In earlier decades, slow strategy was survivable.
Markets were slower.
Information asymmetry was higher.
Execution windows were wider.

That world no longer exists.

Strategy must now:
- React in near-real time
- Handle contradictory inputs
- Enforce constraints automatically
- Compute financial truth, not narrate it

Human consulting cannot meet these requirements at scale.

## The Core Mismatch

| Enterprise Reality | Consulting Reality |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Machine speed | Human availability |
| Deterministic systems | Subjective synthesis |
| Parallel execution | Sequential workflows |
| Computed truth | Opinion arbitration |

This mismatch is irreducible.

No amount of talent, experience, or branding fixes physics.

---

## The Result
Strategy becomes:
- Late
- Politicized
- Over-scoped
- Under-validated

Enterprises are not failing due to poor thinking.
They are failing due to **thinking too slowly**.

Consulting-as-Code™ exists to close this gap.
