# The Neuro-Symbolic Architecture

Consulting-as-Code™ is not built on a language model.

It is built on a **neuro-symbolic system** that explicitly separates:
- Understanding
- Reasoning
- Enforcement

AI listens.
Code thinks.

---

## Why Separation Matters

Human consultants blend:
- Listening
- Interpretation
- Judgment
- Math

This blending introduces bias, fatigue, and error.

LLMs do the same — faster.

Consulting-as-Code™ breaks the stack apart.

## Layer 1: Neural Understanding (AI)

Neural systems are used **only** where they excel:
- Listening to transcripts
- Extracting signals
- Identifying entities
- Detecting sentiment and urgency

They do not decide.
They do not compute.
They do not recommend.

They **extract reality**.

---

## Layer 2: Symbolic Reasoning (Code)

Symbolic systems handle:
- Constraint graphs
- Financial computation
- Dependency resolution
- Prioritization logic

This layer:
- Enforces rules
- Blocks invalid paths
- Rejects infeasible strategies
- Produces deterministic outcomes

No probability.
No temperature.
No improvisation.

## The Critical Insight

Most AI systems try to reason with language.

Consulting-as-Code™ refuses.

Language is noisy.
Code is precise.

Strategy demands precision.

---

## Outcome

This architecture:
- Refuses illegal solutions
- Rejects bad math
- Surfaces true constraints
- Produces auditable logic

It does not ask:
“What sounds right?”

It asks:
“What survives reality?”

This is the foundation of the Logic Core.
