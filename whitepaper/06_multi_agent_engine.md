# The Multi-Agent Consulting Engine

Consulting-as-Code™ replaces the consulting pyramid with a parallel,
multi-agent reasoning system.

Where humans work sequentially, agents work concurrently.
Where humans forget, agents share memory.
Where humans argue politically, agents argue logically.

---

## System Overview

The engine consists of **15 autonomous agents**, divided into two layers:

1. Strategic Call Intelligence (SCI) — 9 agents  
2. AI Discovery Engine — 6 agents  

Together, they execute the entire consulting lifecycle from a single conversation.

---

## Layer 1: Strategic Call Intelligence (SCI)

**Purpose:**  
Replace the discovery phase.

Traditional discovery:
- 3–6 weeks
- $50K–$200K
- Dozens of interviews
- High signal loss

SCI does this in **180 seconds**.

### SCI Agents

1. **Metadata Extractor**  
   Establishes context: company, participants, timing, meeting type.

2. **Pain Point Extractor**  
   Identifies explicit and implicit problems with severity and attribution.

3. **Budget & ROI Analyzer**  
   Extracts budget signals, approval authority, and cost of inaction.

4. **Decision Maker Identifier**  
   Maps stakeholders, influence, blockers, and champions.

5. **Competitive Intelligence Agent**  
   Extracts vendor context, evaluation criteria, and competitive pressure.

6. **Timeline & Urgency Assessor**  
   Detects deadlines, urgency drivers, and execution windows.

7. **Next Steps Recommender**  
   Produces immediate, prioritized action items.

8. **Technical Requirements Extractor**  
   Identifies integration constraints, infrastructure limits, and blockers.

9. **Scaling Context Extractor**  
   Detects pilot-to-program dynamics and calculates scale economics.

---

### SCI Output

A fully structured **Discovery Profile** containing:
- Signals
- Constraints
- Risks
- Opportunities
- Prioritizations

This profile becomes immutable input to the Logic Core.

## Layer 2: AI Discovery Engine

**Purpose:**  
Replace middle management and partner execution.

These agents transform the Strategic Blueprint into a board-ready strategy.

---

### AI Discovery Agents

10. **Use Case Identification Agent**  
    Generates and prioritizes use cases based on feasibility and impact.

11. **Financial Intelligence Agent**  
    Computes margin-correct economics and true addressable value.

12. **Vendor Research Agent**  
    Maps solutions, evaluates build vs. buy, enforces compliance.

13. **Roadmap Creation Agent**  
    Builds phased execution plans with dependencies and budget alignment.

14. **Risk Analysis Agent**  
    Identifies implementation risks with probability and mitigation.

15. **Results Finalization Agent**  
    Assembles all outputs into executive-ready deliverables.

## What This Replaces

This system replaces:
- Discovery workshops
- Analyst research
- Manager synthesis
- Partner review cycles
- Slide deck arbitration

Not by speeding them up —
by **removing them entirely**.
