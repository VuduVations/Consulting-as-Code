# Stress Testing Audits

Any consulting methodology can look correct under ideal conditions.

Real enterprises are not ideal.

They are messy, contradictory, regulated, political, and time-compressed.

Consulting-as-Code™ is designed to survive **failure conditions**.

## Why Stress Testing Matters

Human consultants fail when:
- Information conflicts
- Numbers are misleading
- Constraints are inconvenient
- Executives disagree
- Physics intervenes

LLMs fail when:
- Math is required
- Constraints must be enforced
- Outputs must be reproducible
- They are pressured to please

Stress testing exposes these failures.

## The Audit Gauntlet

Consulting-as-Code™ is subjected to seven real-world audits, each designed
to trigger a known failure mode.

These are not demos.
They are adversarial tests.

Each audit includes:
- A realistic enterprise scenario
- Explicit traps
- Expected human failures
- Expected LLM failures
- The Consulting-as-Code™ result

## The Seven Audits

1. **Margin Squeeze + Code Freeze** (Healthcare)  
   Gross vs. net math + hard IT constraints

2. **Classified Air-Gap + Recurring Cost** (Defense)  
   SCIF security + annualized OpEx math

3. **CEO vs. CTO** (Pharmaceuticals)  
   Executive conflict + regulatory enforcement

4. **Net Loss + Physical Constraints** (Logistics)  
   Insurance deductibles + no-retrofit realities

5. **Labor Math + Privacy Law** (Retail)  
   Union rules + correct labor economics

6. **Basis Points + Explainability** (Banking)  
   Financial precision + OCC compliance

7. **Latency Physics + Opportunity Cost** (Trading)  
   Microseconds vs. revenue collapse

Each audit is documented independently in `/audits/`.

## The Outcome

Seven industries.
Seven failure modes.
Zero failures.

Consulting-as-Code™ does not assume.
It does not negotiate.
It enforces reality.

If a strategy survives these tests,
it survives the enterprise.
