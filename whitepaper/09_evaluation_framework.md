# How to Evaluate AI Consulting Systems

Most “AI consulting tools” are demos.

They summarize transcripts.
They generate slides.
They sound intelligent.

None of that is strategy.

This framework defines the **minimum bar** a system must clear to be trusted
with enterprise decision-making.

## The Seven Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Deterministic Financial Reasoning
**Must be able to:**
- Compute ROI, NPV, IRR
- Distinguish gross vs. net impact
- Run sensitivity analysis

**Fails if:**
- Math changes run to run
- Numbers are approximated
- Opportunity cost is ignored

---

### 2. Constraint Enforcement
**Must be able to:**
- Enforce regulatory, security, and technical constraints
- Block infeasible architectures

**Fails if:**
- Constraints are acknowledged but violated
- “Creative” workarounds are suggested

---

### 3. Multi-Agent Cross-Validation
**Must be able to:**
- Use independent agents to challenge outputs
- Resolve contradictions internally

**Fails if:**
- One model generates everything
- No internal disagreement exists

---

### 4. Reproducibility
**Must be able to:**
- Produce identical outputs from identical inputs

**Fails if:**
- Temperature affects strategy
- Outputs drift over time

---

### 5. Full Consulting Lifecycle Coverage
**Must be able to:**
- Perform discovery, modeling, risk, roadmap, and synthesis

**Fails if:**
- It only summarizes
- It only generates use cases
- It only creates slides

---

### 6. Auditability & Explainability
**Must be able to:**
- Explain why each decision was made
- Trace logic step-by-step

**Fails if:**
- Outputs are black boxes
- Reasoning is invented after the fact

---

### 7. Decision Velocity Alignment
**Must be able to:**
- Deliver insight fast enough to matter
- Scale across many decisions concurrently

**Fails if:**
- Human review is required
- Timelines stretch into days or weeks

---

## The Reality

Most tools fail 5+ of these criteria.

Consulting-as-Code™ was designed to pass all seven.
