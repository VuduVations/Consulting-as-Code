# The New Economics of Strategy

This is not cost reduction.

It is category transformation.

## The Shift

Traditional consulting sells:
- Intelligence for rent
- Delivered by people
- Billed by time
- Constrained by headcount

Consulting-as-Code™ delivers:
- Intelligence as a system
- Delivered by compute
- Billed by execution
- Scaled by infrastructure

---

## Time-to-Value Comparison

| Model | Time-to-Value |
|-----|---------------|
| Traditional Consulting | 4–12 weeks |
| Consulting-as-Code™ | < 3 minutes |

Velocity is no longer an advantage.
It is the requirement.

---

## Cost Structure Inversion

For less than the cost of:
- One junior consultant hour

Enterprises receive:
- Partner-level reasoning
- Full strategic lifecycle
- Math-validated outputs

This is not efficiency.
It is replacement economics.

---

## Ownership vs. Rental

Consulting firms cannot give clients themselves.

Consulting-as-Code™ installs the capability.

Once enterprises own strategy computation,
they will not go back.

---

## The Pattern of History

Whenever compute replaces human labor:
- Accuracy increases
- Cost collapses
- Scale explodes

Consulting is next.
